LangSmith if: You are "All-in-LangChain" and want a, high-end, managed solution for production-grade tracing.

Langfuse if: You prioritize open source, need to keep data on-premise, or use diverse frameworks (e.g., LlamaIndex, raw OpenAI API).

Both tools effectively provide traces, latency monitoring, and cost tracking for AI applications.
